    Many search engines display the Meta description 
    as part of the results page. If a Meta description 
    is not provided, many search engines typically 
    display the first 50-70 words of a document.
    Unfortunately, the header of a document might only 
    contain information about the author and hence it 
    would less likely be viewed. By providing a Meta description, 
    a search engine will more likely display a summary of the 
    document rather than simply the first few sentences.

    <h2 style="background-color: lightblue; font-size: 30px; border: 2px solid green;">Page Titles</h2>

    <p style="color: green; font-size: 22px;">
    Most search engines rank the information in the title of a 
    document higher than the information found in the 
    body of a document. Hence, it is important that a 
    descriptive title be provided for each document. 
    For example, if this document were placed on the Web, 
    either one of the following titles below would describe 
    this document. However, the longer title not only tells 
    the user exactly what to expect when this document is
    viewed, but since it contains more keywords, it would 
    also more likely be retrieved and then viewed.
